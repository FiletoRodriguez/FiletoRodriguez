- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FiletoRodriguez
Currently studying the Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling master studies at @UniversitÃ© Paul Sabatier - Toulouse 3.
My interests right now are focused on electronic structure calculation, even if they may vary in the future. I'll keep it actualized :D
